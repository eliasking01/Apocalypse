# Apocalypse
This is a 2D top down shooter game I made using Unity. I started working on it in April, 2019.

## Download
1. Clone this repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/eliasking01/Apocalypse.git
````
2. Move the ```Apocalypse Maps``` folder into your ```Documents``` folder:
````
mv Apocalypse/'Apocalypse Maps' Documents/
````
3. All done! Now you can open the project in Unity.
